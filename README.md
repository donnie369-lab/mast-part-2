Add New Meals: Easily add new meals to the system with their name, description, category, and price.
View Total Orders: Display the total number of meals added.
Animated Transition: Smooth fade-in animations when adding new meals.
Interactive Meal Categories: Select from categories like Starters, Mains, or Desserts when adding a new meal.

Technologies Used
React Native: For building the mobile app.
React Navigation: For managing the navigation between the screens.
